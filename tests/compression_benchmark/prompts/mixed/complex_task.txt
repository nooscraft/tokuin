You are an AI assistant helping with document processing.

Task: Analyze the following document and extract structured information.

Instructions:
1. Read the entire document carefully
2. Identify key sections (Introduction, Body, Conclusion)
3. Extract important facts and figures
4. Identify any tables or structured data
5. Note any inconsistencies or errors

Document Format:
The document may contain:
- Plain text paragraphs
- Markdown formatting
- Tables
- Code blocks
- Images (describe content)

Output Format:
Provide your analysis as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "sections": ["section1", "section2", ...],
  "key_facts": ["fact1", "fact2", ...],
  "tables": [{"title": "...", "data": [...]}],
  "code_blocks": [{"language": "...", "content": "..."}],
  "issues": ["issue1", "issue2", ...]
}

Critical Requirements:
- DO NOT output any text outside the JSON structure
- Use proper JSON escaping for special characters
- If a field cannot be extracted, use null
- Maintain accuracy - do not guess or infer information
